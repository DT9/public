Year 1 (2022): Foundation & Operational Security
Supported real-time monitoring of alerts and system events using basic DataDOG dashboards and cloud logs.
Assisted in email phishing investigations, classifying threats and creating internal reports on common indicators (IP, domain, attachment types).
Conducted basic malware triage using VirusTotal, Any.Run, and static file analysis tools.
Maintained and updated internal IP/domain blocklists and alert thresholds for noisy or low-fidelity detections.
Helped validate and escalate incidents.
Participated in asset inventory tasks, tracking exposed ports, expired certs, and misconfigured cloud resources using open-source tools.
Contributed to the delivery of security awareness training sessions, focusing on phishing, MFA hygiene, and device hardening.

Year 2 (2023): Cyber Defense Projects / JIRA Strategy
Monitoring AWS GuardDuty, CloudTrail, and Security Hub into a centralized log pipeline (DataDog), enhancing threat visibility across multi-account environments and aligning with CIS AWS Foundations benchmarks.
Designed and deployed Datadog dashboards for each product team, providing tailored visibility into containerized workloads and infrastructure health; collaborated with engineers to define relevant KPIs and log-based alerts.
Engineered and deployed detection signatures for high-impact scenarios including unauthorized access attempts, IAM privilege escalation, and container breakout etc.
Collaborated cross-functionally with sre to harden Containers, implementing least-privilege IAM policies, validating security group configurations, and reducing root users on containers.

Year 3 (2024): Detection Engineering, Threat Intel & Security Program (2025), Dennis (BlueTeam);
Architected and led the deployment of a scalable SIEM platform, correlating telemetry from AWS, Kubernetes, container runtimes, and others endpoints; implemented data normalization, enrichment, and long-term log storage to support detection, audit, and compliance use cases.
Authored and optimized advanced detection rules using Sigma, KQL, and Elasticsearch DSL, targeting high-risk behaviors such as lateral movement, credential abuse, and privilege escalation in ephemeral containerized environments. ( not start )
Expanded threat intelligence capabilities by integrating multiple open-source and commercial threat feeds (e.g., Abuse.ch, MISP, VirusTotal) into the detection pipeline; developed automated enrichment of IOCs in alerts and centralized TI reporting for SOC analysts. ( not start )
Conducted internal threat landscape assessments tailored to the company’s industry and tech stack, helping prioritize detection engineering efforts and patch management based on TTPs mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.
Formalized and scaled the internal CSIRT program, introducing structured incident severity models, on-call escalation procedures, and cross-department incident war rooms to reduce response time and improve post-incident learning.
Integrated proactive incident response playbooks into SOC workflows, and conducted regular simulation drills (tabletop + technical), with focus on ransomware, supply chain compromise, and cloud misconfiguration scenarios. (not start)
Led the creation of an AWS-based forensics lab environment, leveraging snapshots, centralized S3 log buckets, and EC2 analysis instances to safely triage compromised resources without impacting production systems.
Implemented and audited database activity monitoring controls in alignment with APPI (Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information), ensuring visibility into privileged queries, role changes, and anomalous access patterns; partnered with legal and engineering to define thresholds and compliance criteria.
Improved SOC monitoring coverage and efficiency by building metrics to track alert quality, false positive rates, and mean time to respond (MTTR), driving continuous improvement through automation and analyst feedback loops.
Implemented Zero Trust architecture, enforcing strict identity verification and least privilege access across cloud and on-prem environments. (Review)

Optimized Cloudflare WAF, DDoS protection, and bot management, enhancing perimeter defense and reducing attack surface.
