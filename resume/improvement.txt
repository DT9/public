TTP  Technical Competencies
  Threat Intelligence Analysis:
  - "I conducted comprehensive threat hunting focused on ransomware
  groups targeting Japan, analyzing LockBit, BlackCat/ALPHV, Akira,
  and Rhysida operations"
  - "I mapped 13 MITRE ATT&CK tactics and 20+ techniques across these
  groups, showing how they progress from initial access through
  impact"
  - "I consolidated IOCs from government sources (CISA, FBI,
  JPCERT/CC) and commercial feeds (Unit42, Cisco Talos) with
  confidence-based validation"
  Operational Security Implementation:
  - "I designed a staged Cloudflare WAF/Gateway deployment plan with
  <2% false positive targets and comprehensive monitoring metrics"
  - "I established IOC lifecycle management with 30-day review cycles
  and automated expiration processes"
  - "I created risk mitigation controls including TLP classification
  and confidence-based blocking (HIGH=Block, MEDIUM=Challenge)"
  Analytical Skills
  Research Methodology:
  - "I used systematic task prioritization and iterative search
  strategies, progressing from broad landscape analysis to specific
  technical indicators"
  - "I applied a three-source validation rule, requiring government,
  commercial, and community confirmation for high-confidence findings"
  - "I developed a source authority hierarchy with weighted confidence
   scoring (Government 90-95%, Commercial 75-85%)"
  Intelligence Synthesis:
  - "I identified key patterns like the 58% increase in Japan
  ransomware attacks and tracked affiliate migration after law
  enforcement takedowns"
  - "I correlated 222 reported attacks in 2024 with manufacturing
  sector targeting (31%) to assess industry-specific risk"
  Business Impact Understanding
  Strategic Context:
  - "I aligned findings with Japan's Active Cyber Defense Bill and
  NISC restructuring to show regulatory compliance"
  - "I identified $42M in Akira ransom proceeds and major
  infrastructure attacks like the Nagoya port incident affecting
  Toyota operations"
  - "I recommended phased production rollout with executive approval
  gates and business impact assessments"
  Communication Skills
  Multi-Audience Reporting:
  - "I structured the report for three audiences: executive summary
  for C-suite decision-making, technical details for SOC
  implementation, and operational procedures for incident response"
  - "I used standardized frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, TLP
  classifications) to ensure consistent communication across teams"
  Sample Interview Responses
  Q: "Tell me about a complex threat intelligence project you've
  worked on."
  *"I recently conducted a comprehensive threat hunting operation
  focused on ransomware groups targeting Japan. The scope included
  researching four major groups - LockBit, BlackCat, Akira, and
  Rhysida - consolidating validated IOCs, and designing a Cloudflare
  WAF deployment strategy.
  I started by systematically breaking down the project into nine
  prioritized tasks, from initial research through final
  implementation planning. My analysis revealed 222 ransomware attacks
   in Japan during 2024, with manufacturing being the primary target
  at 31%.
  I consolidated IOCs from multiple authoritative sources including
  CISA, FBI, and JPCERT/CC, applying confidence-based validation where
   government sources received 90-95% confidence ratings. The final
  deliverable included a 47-page report with MITRE ATT&CK mapping,
  staging deployment plans, and risk mitigation strategies ready for
  executive approval."*
  Q: "How do you validate threat intelligence sources?"
  *"I use a structured three-tier authority hierarchy combined with
  cross-validation requirements. Tier 1 sources are government
  agencies like CISA and FBI, Tier 2 are established commercial
  vendors like Unit42 and Cisco Talos, and Tier 3 are community
  sources like Abuse.ch.
  For any critical finding, I require validation from at least three
  different source types. For example, when I found claims about
  LockBit 4.0's release, I validated through Unit42's GitHub IOCs,
  security blog reporting, and direct observation of their countdown
  timer. I also track temporal consistency, numerical alignment, and
  methodological transparency across sources."*
  Q: "How do you handle conflicting information from different
  sources?"
  "I use confidence-weighted information fusion. When I encountered
  different statistics about Japan ransomware attacks, I weighted
  sources based on authority, methodology transparency, and track
  record. Government sources like Japan's National Police Agency
  received highest weight, while news reports received lower weights
  unless they cited primary sources directly. I document all conflicts
   and their resolution methods for audit trails."
  Key Strengths to Highlight
  1. Systematic Approach - Structured methodology over ad-hoc research
  2. Technical Depth - IOC validation, MITRE mapping, infrastructure
  analysis
  3. Business Alignment - Risk quantification, regulatory compliance,
  strategic recommendations
  4. Communication Skills - Multi-audience documentation, executive
  briefings
  5. Operational Focus - Implementable solutions with monitoring and
  validation
  This demonstrates you can handle complex, multi-faceted
  cybersecurity projects from initial research through operational
  implementation.
